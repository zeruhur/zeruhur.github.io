Recently I have found again the will to do some worldbuing. The starting points this time are a read and an app.

The former is the curious and (to me) excellent free RPG that goes under the evocative name of [Mazes & Minotaurs](http://mazesandminotaurs.free.fr/). The latter is the amazing [Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator](https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/).

M&M starts with an uchronic assumption: what if Gygax and Anerson decided to use Ancient Greek mithology as inspiration instead of Lord of the Ring to create Dungeons & Dragons? Now the world (of role playing) would be so different! [Someone](http://storygame.free.fr/how.html) build an entire ruleset on this assumption that is fun to read (and to play I guess) on something different to your "elf & dwarves stuck in a underground dungeon" usual campaing.

So I speculate about that a bit. LoTR was a strong influence on the early RPG designers, that became a *de facto* standard when from RPG some campaing logs developed into full lenght novels. After D&D fantasy was not the same for better or for worse.

Here in Italy it is quite usual if one goes to *liceo* (the oldest and respectable form of high school) to grown up absorbed in greek and latin literature. Personally, not only I attended *liceo scientifico* (scientific subjects oriented high school) but I somewhat grown up with greek mithology since my mother brought me a children book on that subject. Then in middle school we studied *Iliad* and *Odissey* with all their connected lore. My literature teacher saw I was passionate about the subject and she assigned to me a greek mithology anthology that summer.
